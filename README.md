# 🐍 Snake Game (Python Turtle)

A **classic Snake Game** built using Python’s built-in **turtle** module.
Move the snake with **WASD** or **Arrow keys**, eat the red food to grow, and try to beat your **High Score**!

---

## ✨ Features

* 🎮 Smooth Snake gameplay
* ⌨️ Controls: **WASD** + **Arrow Keys**
* 📊 Real-time Score & High Score tracking
* ⚡ Snake gets faster each time you eat food
* 🛑 Resets automatically when you hit a wall or yourself

---

## 🖥️ Prerequisites

* **Python 3.8+**
* Works on **Windows / Mac / Linux**
* No external libraries required (only uses Python’s built-in `turtle` module)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** the project.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
   cd snake-game
   ```

2. **Run the game**:

   * On **Windows**:

     ```bash
     py snake_game.py
     ```
   * On **Mac/Linux**:

     ```bash
     python3 snake_game.py
     ```

3. The game window opens immediately.

---

## 🎮 Controls

* **Up**: `W` or ⬆️
* **Down**: `S` or ⬇️
* **Left**: `A` or ⬅️
* **Right**: `D` or ➡️

⚠️ You cannot instantly reverse direction (to prevent self-collision).

---

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Start moving with any control key.
2. Eat the **red circle food** to grow the snake.
3. Each food gives **+10 points** and increases speed slightly.
4. Avoid hitting:

   * The **walls**
   * Your **own body**
5. When you crash, the snake resets but your **High Score remains**!

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Game Setup**

   * Creates a 600×600 black window.
   * Snake head (green square) starts at the center.
   * Food (red circle) placed at random.

2. **Movement**

   * The snake moves in **20-pixel steps**.
   * Controlled by keyboard bindings (WASD + Arrow keys).

3. **Growing the Snake**

   * On eating food:

     * Snake grows by 1 segment (light green square).
     * Score increases by **10**.
     * Speed increases slightly.

4. **Collision Handling**

   * **Wall Collision** → Snake resets.
   * **Self Collision** → Snake resets.
   * Score resets but **High Score** is saved.

5. **Game Loop**

   * Continuously updates the screen.
   * Moves snake, checks collisions, updates score.

---

## 📊 Scoring System

* **+10 points** for every food eaten.
* Speed increases after every food.
* Score resets on crash, but High Score remains for the session.

---

## ⚙️ Customization

* **Change window size**:

  ```python
  win.setup(width=600, height=600)
  ```
* **Change initial speed**:

  ```python
  delay = 0.15  # smaller = faster
  ```
* **Change colors**:

  ```python
  head.color("green")
  food.color("red")
  ```
* **Change font style**:

  ```python
  font=("Courier", 24, "normal")
  ```

---

## 🛠️ Possible Improvements

* ✅ Save High Score permanently in a file.
* ✅ Add obstacles or levels.
* ✅ Wrap-around walls (instead of crash).
* ✅ Add sound effects on eating/collision.
* ✅ Pause/Resume feature.
* ✅ Game Over screen with restart option.
